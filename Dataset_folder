## Dataset: Google Speech Commands V2


This project uses the Google Speech Commands Dataset V2, an open dataset created by Google for training and testing keyword spotting models.
Contains 105,000+ WAV audio clips
Each clip: 1 second long, sampled at 16 kHz, mono-channel
Covers 35 spoken keywords such as:
"yes", "no", "up", "down", "left", "right", "on", "off", "stop", "go", etc.
Includes a folder for background noise (_background_noise_)
Clips recorded by thousands of different people in various environments â€” helps model generalize to different speakers and noise conditions

This dataset is ideal for building offline voice-controlled applications, testing tinyML models, and experimenting with speech recognition on embedded devices.
